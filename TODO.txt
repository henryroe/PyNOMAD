# ASAP

## Make `__version__` updates automatic in nomad.py


# Known Bugs

None.


# Someday/Maybe

## Create a method of accessing a remote copy of the catalog.

Questions:

* consider whether trying to avoid big security holes (i.e. that someone might set this up for anything beyond their own private use)
* have a server process running? or just run something remotely to the host machine via ssh?
* push the necessary python code to host via ssh each time? or need a currently installed copy of nomad.py?
