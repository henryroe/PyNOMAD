The nomad.py module is for accessing a locally hosted copy of The Naval 
Observatory Merged Astrometric Dataset (NOMAD).  More information on 
NOMAD is available at:
    http://www.nofs.navy.mil/nomad/

Full copies of the NOMAD catalog are large:
    92Gigs uncompressed 
        or 
    30Gigs when compressed with:  gunzip --best nomad/[0-9][0-9][0-9]/m*
    
The nomad.py module works with either uncompressed or compressed copies
of the catalog.

Some test data files are included in:
    test_data
These are grabbed directly from USNO's website serving the NOMAD database:
    http://www.nofs.navy.mil/data/fchpix/
These can be used to perform one-time tests cross-checking that the nomad 
module is working correctly with the local copy of the catalog.
These tests (and some other internal consistency checks) can be run by 
using the nomad_test.py module:
    python nomad_test.py
